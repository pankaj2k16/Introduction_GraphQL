# Introduction_GraphQL
GraphQL is designed to address some limitations of traditional REST APIs by providing a more efficient and flexible way to request, manipulate, and expose data. It allows clients to define the structure of the data they require, which promotes efficiency by reducing over-fetching (receiving more data than needed)
